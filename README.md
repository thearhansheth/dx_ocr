# dx_ocr
# Language: Python
# Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, PyTesseract

This is a compliation of some of my works using the opencv and pytesseract libraries to perform OCR functions on various image files in multiple languages
Models include trained language detection datasets that work on images that have undergone enhancement processes through opencv techniques
